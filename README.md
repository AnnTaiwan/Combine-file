## The function of this project is to combine files.
### Directly complile the Part_2.py, and it will compile both .py code(Part_1.py, Part_2.py)
The column names are more similar between KS and RF file, so I combine them first in order not to meet the error.
In Part_2, I have to swap the header and the first row because the result in Part_1 isn't what I want.
**Make sure to delete the blank space.** 
In the future, I might combine all three kind files at once.
